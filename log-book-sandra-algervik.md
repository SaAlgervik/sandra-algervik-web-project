I started the day with trying to find the theme i wanted for the landing page. After that a spent a lot of time finding a non copy right picture i felt gave the right feeling of the page. Then adding the font-family and menu that i wanted. After all that i realized i needed to have buttons instead of links in my menu so i change the menu a bit more.

After all that a sat down and added the issues that i need to work with ahead and planed what i have to do after class tomorrow. 

Sill haven really what AIP i am going to use for the project but i have started to look around and deciding that tomorrow or the day after. 

Tried to make the Log in work but i had to give up after 3h and because it did not work.

Started the day to make the website easier to handle when resize up and down. Then making the layout work as i wanted to. Having some trouble making the text show the way i wanted to. 
Started looking around how to make the log in work as well but.

Started adding some function to the buttons and learning how to implement JavaScript to work the way i want it to. Making the picture stay the same even if i change the content in the div. Just working my way around how things work and all the ways i can use different elements in JavaScript.

Deleted all the files and started again with the Log in and made it work in a new index.html file but i can't add new users and did not really find out the way to do it.
