I started the day with trying to find the theme i wanted for the landing page. After that a spent a lot of time finding a non copy right picture i felt gave the right feeling of the page. Then adding the font-family and menu that i wanted. After all that i realized i needed to have buttons instead of links in my menu so i change the menu a bit more.

After all that a sat down and added the issues that i need to work with ahead and planed what i have to do after class tomorrow. 

Sill haven really what AIP i am going to use for the project but i have started to look around and deciding that tomorrow or the day after. 

Tried to make the Log in work but i had to give up after 3h and because it did not work.

Started adding some function to the buttons and learning how to implement JavaScript to work the way i want it to. Making the picture stay the same even if i change the content in the div. Just working my way around how things work and all the ways i can use different elements in JavaScript.

Deleted all the files and started again with the Log in and made it work in a new index.html file but i can't add new users and did not really find out the way to do it.

After spending about 5-8 h on making the log in halfway work i decided that i did not want to just throw all that time away. So after changing some things in my html file and edited some css i started to fix the log in so it works. And now it does

started the day with styling log in page and added the function so the page opens when you press the button "LOG IN". Spent the rest of the day reading about the API i wanted to use

Spent the whole day tying 10 ways to get info from my api, just got error messages from the console all day. After about 6h i found out that you need a local server to get it to work. After that did everything wrong that i could and now at half past 6 i finally got the server working. Tomorrow i will start with getting the info from the API.
