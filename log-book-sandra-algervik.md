I started the day with trying to find the theme i wanted for the landing page. After that a spent a lot of time finding a non copy right picture i felt gave the right feeling of the page. Then adding the font-family and menu that i wanted. After all that i realized i needed to have buttons instead of links in my menu so i change the menu a bit more.

After all that a sat down and added the issues that i need to work with ahead and planed what i have to do after class tomorrow. 

Sill haven really what AIP i am going to use for the project but i have started to look around and deciding that tomorrow or the day after.
